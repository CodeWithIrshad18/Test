Dear Sir/Madam
As per our records, the validity of your Labour License or the period of acceptance of your Self-Declaration (as applicable and referenced under Ref. No. …………) is ending today, [DD/MM/YYYY].
You are advised to renew or revalidate the document immediately. Alternatively, if no further work is to be executed under the said Labour License or Self-Declaration, you must declare “End of Job” through the HELPDESK portal by selecting:
•	Process Category: End of Job / Notice of Job Closure
•	Complaint Category: Job not to be executed further
Please ensure that a letter declaring “End of Job” (verified by the concerned department) is attached during submission.
In case of “End of Job” declaration, you are also required to:
•	Arrange Full & Final settlement for all contractor workers affected by the job closure.
•	Submit the compliance report through the CLMS F&F Module.
Important:
Despite several reminders, no update has been received regarding the renewal or closure of the self-declaration/labour license (Ref No: …………). As a result, your payment may be placed on hold, and submission of bills through the DBSTS portal will be restricted starting tomorrow (i.e., the day following the expiry date).
You may check the status of your application at: https://services.tsuisl.co.in/CLMS
